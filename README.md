# Heart Disease Classification

This project applies machine learning to classify heart disease based on patient data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to improve predictive accuracy. Implemented using Python with libraries like Scikit-Learn and Pandas.

## Features
- Preprocesses and cleans medical data
- Uses feature engineering for better insights
- Implements multiple machine learning models for classification
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall
- Visualizes key insights using graphs and heatmaps

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nipungoel24/Heart-Disease-Classification.git
cd Heart-Disease-Classification
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Conda Environment  
```bash
conda create -n heartdisease python=3.10
conda activate heartdisease
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the `.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient health records with features like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The target variable indicates whether a patient has heart disease.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models for better accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web API for real-time predictions
- Optimize feature selection techniques
